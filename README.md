# Summary

Chrome does not provide a keyboard shortcut to copy the current tab:
    [Chrome keyboard shortcuts - Computer - Google Chrome Help](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/157179?hl=en)

so, I use an extension called TabCopy that does and also supports different formats (link markdown.) I typically paste these into other documents (like GitHub or OneNote) for bi-directional linking.

One problem I have is typically the titles for web pages served from [Atlassian](https://www.atlassian.com/) (like Jira or Wiki) often have unnecessary suffix's appended making the links unwieldly long.

Every time I paste these them into other documents, I find myself manually removing those suffix's. The site managers for these application explain they cannot remove those suffixes, so I looked for another way to do that.

One suggestion was to look at the Mac Automator:
    [Automator User Guide for Mac - Apple Support](https://support.apple.com/guide/automator/welcome/mac)

The Automator has been around for awhile, and provides a way to create _Quick Action_ s that can be scoped by application, and also assigned keyboard shortcuts.

Thus, I have created such an action here.
